Project Setup Instructions
   I have attached the Angular component files and Spring Boot Java files for this assessment.

Frontend (Angular)
   Copy the provided Angular components, services, and router files into your Angular project using Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor.
   Make sure all necessary imports and module declarations are properly configured in your project.


Backend (Spring Boot)
   Add the provided Java files to your existing Spring Boot project.
   Ensure the necessary dependencies are included in your pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Connect Frontend and Backend:
   Configure your Angular service to point to the correct backend API endpoints.

Start both servers:
   Run ng serve for Angular
   Run your Spring Boot application (e.g., from an IDE or using mvn spring-boot:run)

Accessing the Application:
   Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:4200) to access the application.
